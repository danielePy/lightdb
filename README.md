A very light textual database, very simple and basic. Download the two files maker.py and lightdb.py in the same directory.
Run lightdb.py to build the database on a json file. Then there is the possibility to add data directly from lightdb or you can build a .py file that will serve to manage the database. There is also the possibility to transform the json file into an excel file.
